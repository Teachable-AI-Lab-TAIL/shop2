# SHOP2 Implementation in Python

## Overview

This project is an implementation of SHOP2 (Simple Hierarchical Ordered Planner 2) in Python, featuring a Horn clause inference engine. 
SHOP2 is a powerful AI planning system known for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling a variety of planning problems. Additionally, 
support partial ordering. Our implementation leverages Python's flexibility and accessibility to provide an easy-to-use, yet powerful 
planning solution.

## Features

- **Horn Clause Inference Engine**: Utilizes a Horn clause logic system, allowing for efficient and logical problem-solving capabilities.
- **Partial Ordering**: Using tuples (unordered) and lists (ordered), the system represents partial ordering within the plan.

## Prerequisites

- Python version should be 3.8 or higher
- Install py_plan==1.0 using pip

## Commands
